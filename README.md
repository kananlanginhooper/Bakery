## REQUIREMENTS


You own a bakery. You make several types of bread every day in both pan and round loaves. You’ve decided to create yourself a single page web application to assist you in optimizing your oven space utilization.

You love Next.js and Material UI so you’ve decided to start from the Material + Next.js example project: https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/master/examples/nextjs

You want to optimize your batch of bread as follows: 

● There is a batch of each type of bread, and you make it in either pan or round loaf.

● Every customer will get at least one product matching their exact specifications.

● You make as few round loaves as possible as they are less efficient in utilizing your oven’s square footage.

The interface will allow you to define the types of bread you are making each day, and then enter a list of customer orders with their loaf style preferences. It will then find the optimal arrangement to best satisfy your customers and your budget.

An example batch may be:

You are cooking Sourdough, Whole grain, and Banana bread today and have three customers.



Customer 1 wants a Sourdough round loaf. 

Customer 2 wants a Whole grain pan loaf and Banana round loaf.

Customer 3 wants a Sourdough pan loaf and Whole grain round loaf.

I will have to make all three breads in round loaves. 



Some customer orders may be impossible to fill due to your peculiar restrictions: You are cooking only Sourdough today and have two customers.



Customer 1 wants a Sourdough round loaf. 

Customer 2 wants a Sourdough pan loaf.

No solution exists. You will have to call your customers and get one to compromise.
